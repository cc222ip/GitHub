In a first time, we worked on a very complicated diagram with a lot of relations and a lot of classes too. There was also some system's elements and the verbs to linked the classes were not very goods... (Imparts WS1_G2_v1.png)

After that, we showed this diagram to the tutoring teacher and he said us that a domain model must be more simple and without any kind of system's elements. So, we changed our work for something very simple... Certainly too simple. (Imparts WS1_G2_v2.png)

It is this diagram that we uploaded for the peer review. Indeed, the feedbacks are very bad and all the students who seen our work said it's doesn't finish at all.

So, we decided to read back the lecture and the chapters consecrated at the domain model in the book. I also reviewed some works. It helped us a lot to understand how the domain model must be build.

Finally, we decided to start again the domain model from the beginning to build something better. You can find our final work in PNG or HTML format. (Imparts WS1_G2_v3.png / WS1_G2_v3.html)
